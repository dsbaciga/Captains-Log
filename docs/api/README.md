# API Reference

Travel Life API documentation. The backend provides a RESTful API for all application functionality.

> Last updated: 2026-07-25 — Travel Life v5.6.1

## Base URL

All API endpoints are mounted under `/api`. There is no path versioning.

- **Development**: `http://localhost:5000/api`
- **Production**: `https://your-domain.com/api`

## Service & Health Endpoints

These endpoints are not authenticated and are useful for monitoring and diagnostics.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check, includes database connectivity status | No |
| GET | `/api` | API root - returns name, version, and running status | No |
| GET | `/api/version` | Returns the backend version and package name | No |

## Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT authentication.

### Headers

```text
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Token Lifecycle

- **Access Token**: short-lived; sent in the `Authorization` header.
- **Refresh Token**: long-lived; stored as an `httpOnly` cookie (not exposed to JavaScript).
- On page load, the frontend calls `POST /api/auth/silent-refresh`, which reads the refresh token cookie and returns a fresh access token if the cookie is valid.
- The access token is refreshed transparently by the frontend.

### CSRF Protection

All state-changing (`/api` non-`GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS`) requests are protected by CSRF validation, with a
short exempt list rather than a blanket auth-routes exemption:

- `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/auth/silent-refresh` — these bootstrap the CSRF token, so they cannot require one. **`POST /api/auth/logout` is not on this list — it IS CSRF-validated.**
- `POST /api/user-invitations/accept` and `POST /api/user-invitations/decline/:token` — accessed by unauthenticated users who have no CSRF token; protected instead by the invitation token itself plus rate limiting.

Everything else — including every other authenticated route — requires the `x-csrf-token` header to match the `csrf-token` cookie on any non-safe method.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication (`/api/auth`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/register` | Create new user account | No |
| POST | `/login` | Authenticate user, returns tokens | No |
| POST | `/refresh` | Refresh access token (reads refresh token cookie) | No |
| POST | `/silent-refresh` | Restore auth state from httpOnly cookie on page load | No |
| GET | `/me` | Get current authenticated user | Yes |
| POST | `/logout` | Clear refresh token cookie (works even with an expired token) | No |

### Users (`/api/users`)

All user routes require authentication.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/me` | Get current user profile | Yes |
| GET | `/settings` | Get user settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/settings` | Update user settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/settings/trip-types/rename` | Rename a custom trip type | Yes |
| DELETE | `/settings/trip-types/:typeName` | Delete a custom trip type | Yes |
| PUT | `/settings/categories/rename` | Rename a custom category | Yes |
| DELETE | `/settings/categories/:categoryName` | Delete a custom category | Yes |
| GET | `/immich-settings` | Get Immich integration settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/immich-settings` | Update Immich integration settings | Yes |
| GET | `/weather-settings` | Get weather integration settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/weather-settings` | Update weather integration settings | Yes |
| GET | `/aviationstack-settings` | Get AviationStack (flight tracking) settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/aviationstack-settings` | Update AviationStack settings | Yes |
| GET | `/openrouteservice-settings` | Get OpenRouteService (routing) settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/openrouteservice-settings` | Update OpenRouteService settings | Yes |
| GET | `/smtp-settings` | Get SMTP email settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/smtp-settings` | Update SMTP email settings | Yes |
| POST | `/smtp-settings/test` | Send a test email to verify SMTP configuration | Yes |
| PUT | `/username` | Update username | Yes |
| PUT | `/password` | Update password | Yes |
| GET | `/search` | Search users by email or username (rate limited) | Yes |
| GET | `/travel-partner` | Get travel partner settings | Yes |
| PUT | `/travel-partner` | Update **your own** side of the partnership (rate limited) | Yes |
| GET | `/travel-partner/requests` | List your pending partner requests (incoming and outgoing) | Yes |
| POST | `/travel-partner/requests` | Send a travel partner request (rate limited) | Yes |
| POST | `/travel-partner/requests/{requestId}/accept` | Accept a request — recipient only | Yes |
| POST | `/travel-partner/requests/{requestId}/decline` | Decline a request — recipient only | Yes |
| DELETE | `/travel-partner/requests/{requestId}` | Cancel a request you sent — requester only | Yes |

> Note: a travel partnership auto-shares every new trip either user creates, so it needs
> both sides' consent. `PUT /travel-partner` only ever writes the caller's own row; the
> reciprocal write happens only when the recipient accepts a request.
>
> Both the send and accept calls take an optional `shareExistingTrips` boolean
> (default `false`) that back-shares the **caller's own** existing trips with the other
> user. Each side controls only its own history, so opting in can never grant you access
> to the other user's past trips. Trips flagged `excludeFromAutoShare` are skipped, and
> re-running is idempotent — existing collaborator rows are never duplicated.

> Note: `GET` and `PUT` settings endpoints accept and return only whether sensitive values (API keys, SMTP password) are set; secret values are never returned.

### Expenses & Budget (`/api/trips/:tripId/expenses`)

Trip-scoped expense tracking, plus a budget-vs-spent summary endpoint mounted alongside it.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/api/trips/:tripId/expenses` | Create an expense (`description`, `category`, `amount` required; `category` is one of `food`, `transportation`, `lodging`, `activities`, `shopping`, `other`) | Yes |

Budget summary totals are converted into a single base currency using the exchange rate frozen at each
expense's own date. Amounts that could not be converted are excluded from `spent` and listed under
`conversion.unconverted` rather than summed at face value.

### Airports (`/api/airports`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/` | Search airports by IATA/ICAO code or name (`?q=`); returns airports with a 3-letter IATA code and scheduled passenger service. Powers the airport picker used to add airports to the airports checklist | Yes |

### Calendar (`/api/calendar`)

Unauthenticated iCal subscription feed — the secret token embedded in the URL is the only credential.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|

### Memories (`/api/memories`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/on-this-day` | Get memories (trips, photos, journal entries) from this month/day in prior years. Optional `month`/`day` query params override today's date | Yes |
| GET | `/year-in-review/:year` | Get aggregated travel statistics and highlights for a calendar year (empty aggregates for years with no data) | Yes |

### Public Sharing (`/api/public`)

The only unauthenticated data-serving surface in the app. Access control is the unguessable 64-hex-char
share token itself — every handler 404s unless a trip has that exact token and `shareEnabled` is true.
Requests are rate limited per IP to deter token guessing. Enabling, rotating, and disabling a trip's share
token is done by the trip owner via `POST/DELETE /api/trips/:id/share*` (see Trips).

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/trips/:token` | Get a sanitized, read-only view of a shared trip | No |
| GET | `/trips/:token/photos/:photoId/file` | Stream a shared trip's photo binary (the authenticated `/uploads` route is not reachable without a token) | No |
| GET | `/trips/:token/photos/:photoId/thumbnail` | Stream a shared trip's photo thumbnail | No |

### Push Notifications (`/api/push`)

Web push via VAPID. Endpoints return `503` when push is not configured on the server (no VAPID keys set).

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/public-key` | Get the VAPID public key (or `null` if not configured) | Yes |
| POST | `/subscribe` | Register a web push subscription for the current user (upserts by `endpoint`) | Yes |
| DELETE | `/subscribe` | Remove a web push subscription (`{ endpoint }` in body) | Yes |
| POST | `/test` | Send a test push notification to the caller's active subscriptions | Yes |

### Search (`/api/search`)

The search endpoint is rate limited to 30 requests per minute.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/` | Global search across all entities | Yes |

Query parameters for `GET /api/search` (`backend/src/types/search.types.ts`):

- `q` (required) - search query string
- `type` - a single entity type to search: one of `all` (default), `trip`, `location`, `photo`, `journal`, `trip-series`. Only one value is accepted (not comma-separated). Activities, lodging, and albums are not searchable through this endpoint.
- `limit` - maximum total results (string-encoded number, default `20`)

There is no `tripId` parameter — search is always across all of the current user's trips.

### Collaboration

The collaboration router is mounted at `/api` (not `/api/collaboration` — there is no such prefix); routes
below are grouped under `/api/invitations` and `/api/trips/...`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|

| GET | `/api/trips/:tripId/invitations` | List pending invitations for a trip | Yes |
| POST | `/api/trips/:tripId/invitations` | Send an invitation to collaborate on a trip | Yes |
| DELETE | `/api/trips/:tripId/invitations/:invitationId` | Cancel a pending trip invitation | Yes |
| POST | `/api/trips/:tripId/invitations/:invitationId/resend` | Resend a pending trip invitation | Yes |

Backup and restore endpoints accept large payloads (up to 100MB). The create/restore endpoints are rate limited.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/create` | Create and download a backup (ZIP archive of all user data) | Yes |
| POST | `/restore` | Restore user data from a backup file (overwrites existing data) | Yes |
| GET | `/info` | Get backup info including entity counts and estimated size | Yes |

### AI

AI features are trip-scoped and mounted under `/api/trips/:tripId/ai`. All AI endpoints are rate limited (per-user).

| POST | `/api/trips/:tripId/ai/journal-summary` | Generate an AI summary of the trip's journal entries | Yes |

> Related: `POST /api/journal/:id/ai-enhance` (see Journal Entries) also uses AI to enhance a single journal entry.

### PDF Imports (`/api/pdf-imports`)

Upload travel documents (PDFs) and let AI extract trip data into pending entities for review. The upload and reparse endpoints are rate limited (per-user AI limiter).

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |

| POST | `/:id/reparse` | Re-run AI parsing on an existing import | Yes |
| DELETE | `/:id` | Delete a PDF import | Yes |

### Saved Links (`/api/saved-links`)

Reference URLs kept alongside a trip. Links are user-scoped and may exist with no
trip (the "inbox"), which is why these routes are not nested under `/api/trips`.
Open Graph metadata is fetched in the background after creation, so a new link is
returned immediately with `metadataStatus: "PENDING"`.

Tracking parameters (`utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, and similar) are stripped from
the URL before it is stored. URLs resolving to internal or private addresses are
rejected with a 400.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/` | Save a link, optionally assigning it to a trip | Yes |
| GET | `/` | List saved links; `?tripId=<id>` or `?tripId=none` for the inbox | Yes |
| GET | `/inbox-count` | Count of links not yet assigned to a trip | Yes |
| GET | `/:id` | Get a saved link by ID | Yes |
| PATCH | `/:id` | Update a link; `tripId: null` returns it to the inbox | Yes |
| DELETE | `/:id` | Delete a link and any entity links pointing at it | Yes |
| DELETE | `/bulk` | Delete several links by `{ ids: [] }`; all-or-nothing | Yes |
| DELETE | `/inbox` | Delete every link not assigned to a trip | Yes |
| POST | `/:id/refresh-metadata` | Re-scrape Open Graph metadata | Yes |
| GET | `/api/trips/:tripId/saved-links` | List a trip's links (visible to collaborators) | Yes |

Saved links participate in the entity-linking system as `SAVED_LINK`, so they can
be attached to activities, lodging, locations, and the rest via
`/api/trips/:tripId/links`.

Links also arrive by email. A background job polls a configured IMAP mailbox, and
messages from a recognised sender have their URLs captured as saved links with
`source: "EMAIL"` and no trip, landing in the inbox. There is no endpoint for
this — it is cron-driven — but the trusted-sender list is managed here:

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|
| GET | `/api/users/link-ingest` | Get the ingest mailbox and trusted sender list | Yes |
| PUT | `/api/users/link-ingest` | Replace the trusted sender list (max 20) | Yes |

### Flight Tracking

Flight tracking endpoints are mounted under `/api` and scoped to transportation or trips. They use the AviationStack API.

## Response Format

Most responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { },
  "message": "Optional message"
}
```

Some endpoints return binary content directly (e.g. image proxies, backup ZIP downloads) rather than the JSON envelope.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "trip": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Japan 2024"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Response

A generic error response contains a `status` and a `message`:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

Validation errors (Zod) additionally include a `fields` array naming the invalid fields:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "fields": ["title", "startDate"]
}
```

Unique constraint violations include the offending `field`:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "A record with this value already exists",
  "field": "email"
}
```

> The error response does not include a machine-readable `code` field.

## Common Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 201 | Created |
| 400 | Bad Request (validation error) |
| 401 | Unauthorized (invalid/missing token) |
| 403 | Forbidden (insufficient permissions) |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 413 | Payload Too Large (e.g. oversized upload) |
| 429 | Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded) |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |
| 503 | Service Unavailable (e.g. database down, Immich unreachable) |

## Pagination

Album endpoints support `skip`/`take` pagination:

```text
GET /api/albums?skip=0&take=30
GET /api/albums/:id?skip=0&take=40
```

Trip listing uses page-based pagination instead — `page`/`limit` (default `limit` 20) — and the response
body includes the paging metadata alongside the results:

```json
{
  "trips": [ ],
  "total": 42,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "totalPages": 3
}
```

## Filtering

Several endpoints support filtering via query parameters:

```text
GET /api/trips?status=completed&search=japan
GET /api/checklists?tripId=5
GET /api/search?q=tokyo&type=trip&limit=20
```

## File Uploads

Photo uploads use `multipart/form-data` and accept the `photo` field:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "photo=@/path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "tripId=1" \
  -F "caption=My photo" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/photos/upload
```

Other multipart uploads:

- Companion avatars: `POST /api/companions/:id/avatar`, field `avatar` (max 5MB)
- PDF imports: `POST /api/pdf-imports/upload`, field `file` (max 25MB, PDF only)
- Backup restore: `POST /api/backup/restore`, field `backup`

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits are applied per IP or per user depending on the endpoint:

- General API: 1000 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Auth routes (`/api/auth/*`): 15 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Silent refresh (`/api/auth/silent-refresh`): 60 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Search (`/api/search`): 30 requests per minute per IP
- Backup create/restore, AI endpoints, PDF import upload/reparse, and sensitive user endpoints have their own dedicated limiters.

Rate-limited requests receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

> No endpoint in the backend returns `204 No Content`. Deletes return `200` with the standard
> `{ status: 'success', message }` envelope, same as any other successful response.
