## 🗺️ Location & Map Features

### 40. Points of Interest Suggestions

**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Auto-suggest nearby attractions, restaurants, landmarks.

**Current State**: Nominatim integration exists, POI suggestions not implemented
**Enhancement**: Integrate POI database, suggestion engine.

### 41. Location Reviews & Ratings

**Category**: User Content
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Personal ratings and notes for visited places.

**Implementation**: Add rating field to Location model, UI for star ratings.

**Scope note (2026-07-25)**: worth widening beyond Location. There is currently no
rating field anywhere in the schema, so lodging, activities, and restaurants can't be
scored either — and those are what you actually want to look back on. A 1-5 rating plus
a short "would I return?" verdict across Location, Lodging, and Activity turns the
archive into something queryable ("best meals of 2025", "hotels I'd rebook") and gives
Year in Review (#55) real material. Doing all four at once is barely more work than
Location alone.

### 42. Offline Maps

**Impact**: High

**Description**: Download map tiles for offline access during travel.

- Privacy controls
- GPX track import (watches, hiking apps, dashcams) alongside Google Takeout

**Scope note (2026-07-25)**: this is the strongest argument for the PostGIS extension,
which is enabled but barely used today (`Location.coordinates` and `Photo.coordinates`
are the only geography columns). A day's imported track gives `DayMiniMap` a real route
line instead of scattered pins, and the timestamps make two other features cheap:
auto-detecting which places were actually visited, and inferring locations for photos
that have no EXIF GPS (see #101).

### 69. Booking Integrations

**Category**: Integration
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: High

**Description**: Import booking confirmations (flights, hotels, activities) into trips.

**Current State**: Delivered via the PDF + AI import system. Users upload a booking-confirmation PDF, which is parsed by an LLM (`pdfImport` controller/service + `pdfParser.service.ts`) to extract flights, lodging, and activities. Extracted items land in a review queue (`PendingEntity`) before being added to the trip.

**Note**: An earlier email-parsing implementation was built and then removed (commit `8ffab4e`, migration `20260406000000_remove_email_import`) in favor of the PDF + AI import approach. What failed there was specifically **LLM parsing of booking emails into structured entities** — see the commit messages in between ("still working on email parsing... even now", "updating email parsing logic again again" ×2).

**Update 2026-07-25**: the inbound-mail half now exists. Saved-link email ingest added
`emailIngest.service.ts` (IMAP poll, sender verification, dedupe on Message-ID, archive
after processing) plus the `EmailIngest` model and `IMAP_*` config. Revisiting
booking-email import is therefore much cheaper than last time — the transport,
credentials, scheduling, and crash recovery are all built and tested. Only the
booking-parsing step would be new, and that is precisely the part that failed before,
so it should be attempted only with a review queue in front of it (`PendingEntity`
already provides one).

**Features**:
- ✅ PDF upload + LLM-based parsing of booking confirmations
- ✅ Auto-populate booking details (flights, hotels, activities)
- ✅ Review/confirm extracted entities before linking to a trip
- [ ] Direct integrations with booking provider APIs (not started)

**Status**: ✅ Booking-confirmation import delivered via PDF + AI import

## 🧹 Technical Debt

### 95. Type `transformTripToBackupFormat` Properly

**Category**: Technical Debt
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: `backup.service.ts` declares `fetchTripWithRelatedData(): Promise<Record<string, unknown> | null>`,
throwing away the precise type Prisma already infers. `transformTripToBackupFormat` then re-establishes
the shape with **73 `as` assertions**. Flagged by automatic code review 2026-07-25; deferred because
another change was in flight on the same file at the time.

Some of those assertions hide genuine mismatches rather than merely restating a known type — e.g.
`trip.startDate as string | null` where Prisma returns `Date | null`. These currently "work" only
because `JSON.stringify` serialises `Date` to a string on the way out, so the in-memory type is a lie.

**Approach**:

- Extract the 169-line `include` object to a named const (`tripBackupInclude`)
- Derive `type TripWithRelations = Prisma.TripGetPayload<{ include: typeof tripBackupInclude }> & { photos: BackupPhoto[] }`
- Change both signatures to use it, then delete the now-redundant assertions

**Notes**: A spike confirmed the type resolves cleanly once the const is extracted — the only blocker
was the missing named include. The unknown is how many `Date`→`string` / `Decimal`→`number` mismatches
surface as real errors; resolving those means correcting `BackupTrip`'s field types. `FlexibleDateSchema`
in `backup.types.ts` is existing precedent for accepting both. Touches the backup/restore round-trip,
so pair it with a full backup → wipe → restore test.

## 💡 Ideas Review — 2026-07-25

Generated from a fresh pass over the schema, services, and components. Items that
duplicated existing entries were folded into those instead of listed again — ratings
into #41, GPX import into #43, booking email into #69. Already covered elsewhere and
deliberately not repeated here: photo dedupe (#39, #92), video (#34), day-route
optimisation (#44), trip templates (#1, #48), comments (#50), version history (#62),
live trip updates (#53), achievements (#81), Google Timeline import (#43).

### 96. Multi-Currency with Exchange Rates

**Category**: Budget & Expenses
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Description**: Store an exchange rate and base-currency amount alongside every costed
record, snapshotted at the transaction date.

**Why this is more than a nice-to-have**: `expense.service.ts` documents the current
behaviour in a comment — amounts are summed **with no FX conversion** and reported under
a single display currency. A €500 hotel and a ¥500 dinner currently add up to "1000".
Every mixed-currency trip shows a wrong total today.

**Features**:
- `exchangeRate` + `baseAmount` on TripExpense, Activity, Transportation, Lodging
- Rate fetched at transaction date from a free FX API, then frozen
- User's home currency as the reporting currency
- Backfill path for existing rows (assume trip currency, flag as estimated)

**Dependencies**: unblocks #106; makes #17 (Expense Predictions) meaningful.

**Status**: ✅ Completed 2026-07-25 — `exchangeRate`/`baseAmount`/`baseCurrency` snapshotted per
costed row, `exchangeRate.service.ts` backed by Frankfurter (keyless), rates cached per
(date, pair) in `exchange_rates` and never re-fetched. All FX math in `Prisma.Decimal`, never
floats. The **budget is converted too**, so a USD budget no longer compares against EUR spend.
Amounts that could not be converted are **excluded from `spent`** and reported separately rather
than silently mixed in. Activity/Transportation/Lodging fill in lazily on first budget read;
`scripts/backfill-currency-conversion.ts` handles legacy rows.

### 97. Expense Splitting & Settle-Up

**Category**: Budget & Expenses
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Description**: Record who paid and who owes, then settle up at the end of a trip.

**Current State**: `TripExpense` has no `paidBy` and no split. `TravelCompanion` and
`TripCollaborator` already model the people.

**Features**:
- `paidBy` (companion) on expenses
- Equal / custom-amount / percentage splits
- Settle-up view that minimises the number of transactions
- Per-person totals in the budget summary

**Value**: removes the need for a separate Splitwise on every group trip.

### 98. Trip Wishlist / Bucket List

**Category**: Travel Planning
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Places you want to go, not attached to any trip.

**Current State**: everything location-shaped is `tripId`-scoped, so a place you haven't
planned yet has nowhere to live. Distinct from Favorite Places (#12), which stars
Locations that already belong to a trip.

**Features**:
- Standalone wishlist entries with notes, links, and a rough season/time-of-year
- Pinned on the Places Visited map in a distinct colour
- "Convert to trip location" when a trip finally gets planned
- Pairs naturally with the `Dream` trip status that already exists

### 99. People in Photos

**Category**: Photo Management
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Tag which companions appear in which photos.

**Current State**: no face or person data anywhere in the schema.

**Features**:
- Manual tagging of `TravelCompanion` on photos
- Optional import of Immich's existing face/person data via its API
- "Every photo of X" view across all trips
- Companion avatars on photo cards

### 100. Photo Favorites & Highlight Reel

**Category**: Photo Management
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Star individual photos and auto-assemble a per-trip highlight set.

**Current State**: `Location` has `isFavorite`; `Photo` does not.

**Features**:
- Star toggle on photos, mirroring the location pattern
- "Favorites" filter in the gallery and lightbox
- Auto-generated highlight reel per trip, shareable via the existing public share

### 101. Infer Photo Location from Itinerary

**Category**: Photo Management
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: For photos with no EXIF GPS, infer where they were taken by matching
`takenAt` against the trip timeline.

**Distinct from #39**, which suggests locations *from* EXIF GPS. This is the inverse and
covers the harder case: scanned film, screenshots, phones with location off, and photos
imported from someone else's camera.

**Features**:
- Match `takenAt` against activities, lodging stays, and transportation legs
- Confidence indicator, and never overwrite real EXIF data
- Bulk "apply suggestions" with review
- Much stronger once GPX tracks exist (#43)

### 102. Opening Hours & Closure Warnings

**Category**: Location Intelligence
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Description**: Store opening hours per location and warn when a plan hits a closure.

**Current State**: `Location` has no hours field. OSM/Nominatim frequently carries an
`opening_hours` tag already, so much of this is a parse rather than a new data source.

**Features**:
- `openingHours` on Location, populated from OSM where available
- Timezone-aware "is it open then?" check against `visitDatetime`
- Warning surfaced through the existing Trip Health Check (#2)

**Why it matters**: a 9am Monday museum visit is the single most common real-world
itinerary failure, and the app currently has no way to catch it.

**Status**: ✅ Completed 2026-07-25 — `Location.openingHours` (raw OSM string as the single
source of truth), `openingHoursSource` so a manual entry is never clobbered by the automatic
lookup, and `Location.timezone` auto-derived via `tz-lookup`. `openingHours.service.ts` parses a
documented subset (weekday ranges incl. wrapping, multiple ranges per rule, `24/7`, `off`,
midnight-crossing, `;` override semantics) and **fails closed to `UNKNOWN`** for anything outside
it — month/date selectors, `sunrise`/`sunset`, `Mo[1]`, `||` fallbacks. `PH`/`SH` are evaluated
both ways and only answer when both agree. Evaluation uses `formatInTimeZone` rather than
`toZonedTime` + local getters, which misreports across DST. **No UTC fallback**: no timezone means
`UNKNOWN`, never a comparison against the wrong clock. Health check fires only on a definite
`CLOSED`, so it never cries wolf. Nominatim population is best-effort and post-commit. 91 tests.

### 103. Reverse Itinerary from a Flight

**Category**: Travel Planning
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Enter a flight number and have the surrounding day built for you.

**Current State**: `aviationstack.service.ts` and `airport.service.ts` already resolve
flight numbers to routes and times.

**Features**:
- Auto-create the transportation leg from a flight number + date
- Block travel-day time so it can't be double-booked
- Suggest lodging near the arrival airport
- Prompt for ground transport on both ends

### 104. Activity Proposals & Voting

**Category**: Collaboration
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Collaborators suggest activities that need approval before entering the
itinerary.

**Current State**: `TripCollaborator` exists with view/edit/admin, but any editor writes
straight into the trip. Group planning has no conflict-free path.

**Features**:
- Proposed state for activities, separate from the committed itinerary
- Thumbs-up / thumbs-down per collaborator with a threshold to promote
- Push notification on new proposals (infrastructure already shipped)
- Distinct from Comments (#50), which discusses rather than decides

### 105. Public Trip Guestbook

**Category**: Social & Sharing
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Low

**Description**: Let visitors to a shared trip leave a short note.

**Current State**: `share.routes.ts` is strictly read-only by design.

**Features**:
- Moderated notes on the public trip page
- Owner approves before anything is visible
- Rate limited, no accounts required
- Cheap and high-delight; scope carefully to avoid becoming Comments (#50)

### 106. Spending Pace & Cost-per-Day Benchmarks

**Category**: Analytics
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Track burn rate against budget during a trip, and compare cost-per-day
across trips afterwards.

**Distinct from #57** (Travel Pace Analysis), which measures days per destination rather
than money.

**Features**:
- "60% through the trip, 80% through budget" indicator on the dashboard
- Cross-trip cost-per-day comparison ("Japan $180/day vs Portugal $95/day")
- Breakdown by category over time

**Dependencies**: needs #96 to be trustworthy on mixed-currency trips.

### 107. Semantic Archive Search

**Category**: Search
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Search the archive by meaning rather than keyword.

**Current State**: `search.service.ts` is keyword-based across five entity types.

**Features**:
- Embed journal entries, photo captions, notes, and saved-link descriptions
- pgvector alongside the existing PostGIS extension
- Answers "that seafood place with the blue door" across a decade of travel
- Hybrid with the existing keyword search rather than replacing it

### 108. Post-Trip Retrospective

**Category**: Travel Planning
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Prompt for what worked and what didn't after a trip completes, then
resurface those lessons while planning the next one.

**Features**:
- Prompts on transition to `Completed` (what to repeat, what to skip, what to pack differently)
- Answers stored as a structured trip retrospective
- Relevant lessons surfaced during planning ("last time you underpacked layers")
- Feeds packing suggestions, which already exist

### 109. Loyalty Programs & Membership Numbers

**Category**: Travel Documents
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Store frequent-flyer and hotel-loyalty numbers, and auto-fill them into
bookings.

**Current State**: no model for this; numbers currently live in notes fields if anywhere.

**Features**:
- Per-programme membership numbers and status tiers
- Auto-fill into transportation and lodging records by carrier match
- Optional manual points balance
- Sits naturally beside `TravelDocument`

### 110. Travel Day Document Vault

**Category**: Mobile & PWA
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Description**: One offline-cached screen with everything needed at a check-in desk.

**Current State**: `TravelDocument` stores the documents; there is no consolidated
day-of view, and offline caching is per-query.

**Features**:
- Passport, boarding passes, confirmations, and insurance on one screen
- Explicitly cached for offline, since airports are where connectivity fails
- Ordered by what's needed next
- Builds on the PWA work (#64) already shipped

### 111. Emergency Card

**Category**: Travel Documents
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: A printable, offline card of the things you need when something goes
wrong.

**Features**:
- Local emergency numbers and nearest embassy for the destination
- Insurance policy number and assistance line
- Companion medical notes and allergies (dietary tags already model adjacent data)
- Printable and offline-cached; useful precisely when the phone is dead or stolen

**Status**: ✅ Completed 2026-07-26 — `TripEmergencyInfo` (per-trip insurance provider, policy
number, assistance line, embassy contact) plus `TravelCompanion.medicalNotes`/`.allergies`
alongside the existing `dietaryPreferences`. The destination country is **`Trip.countryCode`**,
not a field on the emergency record: the country is a fact about the trip, and #113 reads the
same column, so a correction made on either card holds for both. **Embassy details are user-entered, not bundled**:
"nearest embassy" is a per-(passport, destination) pair and far too large to ship offline.
Emergency numbers come from the shared `constants/countryFacts.ts` snapshot, and country
resolution runs **client-side** (`utils/emergencyCountry.ts`) precisely so the offline card's
core logic never sits behind the network. Cached in IndexedDB via a new `emergencyCards` store,
and printing uses the existing `print-*-wrapper` portal convention from `Timeline.tsx` —
allergies are underlined bold rather than red so they survive a monochrome printer. Companion
medical fields are **owner-only**, nulled for collaborators with an explicit "owner only" flag
so the card never implies nothing was recorded. Missing numbers are dropped, never rendered as
"none". Migration `20260729000000_add_emergency_card` is **created but not applied**. 35 tests.

### 112. Transit & Rideshare Deep Links

**Category**: Location & Maps
**Effort**: Very Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: One tap from any timeline event to directions in the user's preferred
maps app.

**Features**:
- Deep links to Apple/Google Maps, Citymapper, Uber/Lyft
- Origin and destination pre-filled from the surrounding itinerary items
- Per-user preferred app in Settings

**Why it's worth doing**: trivial to build, and used constantly on the ground.

**Status**: ✅ Completed 2026-07-25 — `lib/mapsDeepLinks.ts` (pure builders for Apple, Google,
Citymapper, Uber, Lyft; platform is an explicit argument, never read from `window`) plus
`lib/itineraryPlaces.ts` entity adapters and a reusable `DirectionsButton`. Wired into Timeline
and Daily View, both of which have a chronological ordering, so **origin is inferred from the
nearest preceding item with a real place** — a restaurant routes from the hotel rather than from
nowhere. Transportation's destination is its *departure* point (you need to reach the airport)
while its *end* place feeds the next item's origin. Activities with no coords and no address
produce no button rather than a garbage maps search. Preferred app per user in Settings. 79 tests.

### 113. Local Norms Card

**Category**: Advanced Features
**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: Per-country practical conventions, shown on the trip.

**Features**:
- Tipping norms, plug type and voltage, tap-water safety, driving side
- Rough emergency numbers (overlaps #111 — share the dataset)
- Static bundled dataset; no API dependency, works offline
- Pairs with the existing `VisaRequirement` and `TripLanguage` features

**Status**: ✅ Completed 2026-07-26 — frontend-only by design, reading the shared
`constants/countryFacts.ts` snapshot (123 countries), so it works with the radio off and
costs no migration. **No country column exists anywhere in the schema** — `Trip` has none and
`Location` carries only free-text `address` — so `useTripCountries` resolves candidates from
every location address and tallies them. A trip spanning several countries is first-class: it
renders a chip row with per-country location counts rather than silently picking one. Zero
resolved countries offers a 123-country picker instead of an empty card. **Correcting** the
country writes the shared `Trip.countryCode` (so the emergency card agrees), while **viewing**
another of a multi-country trip's countries is deliberately local and instant — persisting a
view would move the emergency card's numbers to the wrong country and would need a network
round-trip for what must stay an offline interaction. Both dataset caveats are honoured in the UI:
a missing emergency number renders as *absent*, never as "no such service", and Japan's 50/60Hz
and Brazil's 127/220V mixed grids get explicit per-country notes. 11 tests.

### 114. Conversational Trip Planner

**Category**: AI/ML
**Effort**: High
**Impact**: Medium

**Description**: A chat interface with the trip as context.

**Current State**: AI is limited to link suggestions and journal summaries
(`ai.routes.ts`). #91 covers auto-tagging and summarisation, not conversation.

**Features**:
- Trip-scoped chat ("find a rainy-day alternative for Tuesday afternoon near the hotel")
- Returns **proposed** entities through the existing `PendingEntity` review queue, so
  nothing is written without approval
- Reuses `llm.service.ts` and the per-user key handling already in place

**Risk**: the removed email import (#69) is the cautionary tale — LLM output that writes
directly to the itinerary was what failed. Keep the review queue in front of it.

## Update Log

- **2026-07-25 (evening)**: Shipped #96 (multi-currency with FX rates), #102 (opening hours & closure warnings), and #112 (transit & rideshare deep links). Built in parallel in isolated worktrees. Backend +144 tests, frontend +81, zero new failures against the v5.6.0 baseline of 30 pre-existing ones. Note for future verification: `npx tsc --noEmit` in `frontend/` is a **no-op** — the root `tsconfig.json` has `"files": []` with only project references, so it silently checks nothing. Use `npx tsc -b` (which is what `npm run build:strict` already does); the shortcut hid a real type error in this batch
- **2026-07-25**: Added #96–#114 from a fresh pass over the schema and services. Ideas that duplicated existing entries were folded into those rather than listed twice — ratings widened in #41, GPX import added to #43, booking-email import updated in #69 (the IMAP transport now exists after the saved-link email ingest work, so it is far cheaper than the 2026-04 attempt). Also added #95 (Technical Debt: `transformTripToBackupFormat` type assertions). Highest-value new items: #96 multi-currency, which fixes a real correctness bug where mixed-currency budget totals are simply summed without conversion; #102 opening hours, which catches the most common itinerary failure; and #97 expense splitting
- **2026-07-19 (evening)**: Feature batch shipped — Budget & expense tracking (`TripExpense` + Budget tab + dashboard widget), Public trip sharing (#87), On This Day memories (#37, app-internal) + Year in Review (#55), iCal feed (one-way subscription form of Calendar Sync #68), Push notifications (#67, completing PWA #64), Trip Archive (#25), Favorite Places (#12, location starring), Default Timezone (#21), plus Immich regression tests
- **2026-07-19**: Code audit — marked as completed: Trip Cover Images (#31, via `bannerPhotoId`), Offline Maps (#42), Trip Collaboration UI (#46), PWA (#64, all but push notifications), Flight Tracking (#71), Weather Integration (#72). Also now in the app but never tracked here: trip dashboard ("today" view with widgets), Day By Day view, Kanban trips view, souvenir tracking, jet lag calculator, OIDC/SSO, AI link suggestions and journal summaries, airport search. See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- **2026-05-15**: Marked Custom Trip Types (#15) and Markdown Support (#24) as completed; rewrote Booking Integrations (#69) to reflect PDF + AI import (email parsing was removed)
- **2026-01-16**: Consolidated from FEATURE_IDEAS.md and FEATURE_IDEAS_EXTENDED.md, organized by priority
- **Previous**: Multiple separate feature idea documents maintained
