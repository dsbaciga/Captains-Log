 * errors while offline — `cachedAt` tells the UI the payload is a mirror. Retries
 * are off for the same reason: the fallback has already happened by the time the
 * promise settles, so retrying only delays rendering a card someone needs now.
 *
 * @param tripId - The trip to load
 * @returns The card, its cache age, the resolved country, and query state
 *
 * @example
 * const { card, country, cachedAt } = useEmergencyCard(tripId);
 * const numbers = listEmergencyNumbers(country.facts?.emergency);
