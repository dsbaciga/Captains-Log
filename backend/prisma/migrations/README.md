# Prisma migrations — READ BEFORE DEPLOYING

## STOP — one mandatory manual step on every existing database

A baseline migration, `00000000000000_init`, was added on 2026-07-25. It creates the
**entire schema from empty**.

Every database that already contains data — production, the developer database, any
restored dump — **must have it marked as already applied, exactly once, before the next
`prisma migrate deploy`**:

```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 00000000000000_init
```

Run that command **once per existing database**, from `backend/`, with `DATABASE_URL`
pointing at that database. It writes a bookkeeping row into `_prisma_migrations`; it
executes **no SQL against your tables**.

If you skip it, `prisma migrate deploy` will try to run the baseline against a database
where those tables already exist. The migration is guarded — its first statement aborts
with `REFUSING TO RUN BASELINE 00000000000000_init: table "users" already exists` and
Prisma rolls the whole file back — so **your schema and data are not damaged**. But the
deploy fails and no subsequent migration is applied.

Only a genuinely empty database should ever let the baseline execute.

## Recovering after the baseline has already failed (`P3009`)

Once the guard has tripped, the baseline is recorded in `_prisma_migrations` as a *failed*
migration, and every later `migrate deploy` refuses immediately:

```text
Error: P3009
migrate found failed migrations in the target database, new migrations will not be applied.
The `00000000000000_init` migration started at ... failed
```

**The single `--applied` command above is not enough at this point** — Prisma rejects
`--applied` for a migration already recorded as failed. Clear the failed state first, then
record it as applied:

```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 00000000000000_init
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied     00000000000000_init
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

`--rolled-back` is truthful here: the guard aborted the very first statement and Prisma
rolled the file back, so nothing from the baseline was ever committed.

If the backend container is crash-looping (its entrypoint runs `migrate deploy` and exits
on failure), you cannot `docker exec` into it. Run the recovery from a one-off container on
the same network instead:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --network <app network, see: docker network ls> \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@db:5432/travel_life?schema=public' \
  -w /app ghcr.io/dsbaciga/travel-life-backend:vX.Y.Z \
  sh -c 'npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 00000000000000_init \
      && npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 00000000000000_init \
      && npx prisma migrate deploy'
```

Then start the app normally.

## Why the baseline exists

Migration history had no baseline. No migration created the core tables (`users`,
`trips`, `locations`, …) — the oldest one, `20251015_add_user_timezone`, is a bare
`ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN`, assuming the table already exists. The production
database only works because its schema was created out-of-band. `prisma migrate deploy`
against a genuinely empty database therefore failed on the very first migration.

`00000000000000_init` was generated offline from the current schema with:

```bash
npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma --script
```

It contains all 37 tables, the enums, `CREATE EXTENSION postgis`, every index and
foreign key, plus (hand-appended) the four `CHECK` constraints Prisma cannot express.
It reflects the schema **as of today**, not as of 2025 — see the next section.

## Provisioning a genuinely fresh database

The baseline creates the *current* schema, so the 51 legacy migrations that follow it
would replay DDL that already exists (`ADD COLUMN "timezone"` on a `users` table that
already has it, etc.). Most of them are not idempotent, so **`prisma migrate deploy`
alone still cannot provision a fresh database in one shot.** Fixing that properly would
mean rewriting history; instead, provision a fresh database like this:

```bash
# 1. Create the schema from the baseline.
#    (db execute reads the datasource from prisma.config.ts / DATABASE_URL.)
npx prisma db execute --file prisma/migrations/00000000000000_init/migration.sql

# 2. Record the baseline and every legacy migration as applied
#    (their content is already inside the baseline).
for d in prisma/migrations/*/; do
  npx prisma migrate resolve --applied "$(basename "$d")"
done

# 3. From here on, normal deploys work.
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Step 2 marks the four 2026-07-28 migrations as applied too; that is correct, because
their effects are already present in the baseline (they are written to be no-ops
against a database that already has them anyway).

## Migrations added 2026-07-25 (safe on a populated database)

| Migration | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `00000000000000_init` | Baseline. **Must be `migrate resolve --applied` on existing databases — see the top of this file.** |
| `20260728000000_add_weather_data_trip_date_unique` | De-duplicates `weather_data` (keeps the most recently fetched row per trip-day), then adds `UNIQUE (trip_id, date)`. Weather rows are a re-fetchable cache. |
| `20260728010000_add_trip_expense_trip_date_index` | Adds `INDEX (trip_id, date)` on `trip_expenses`, matching the list query's sort. |
| `20260728020000_add_trip_expense_amount_check` | Adds `CHECK (amount >= 0)` as `NOT VALID`, then validates it only if no negative rows exist. Cannot fail on legacy data. |
| `20260728030000_backfill_postgis_coordinates` | One-time backfill of `locations.coordinates` / `photos.coordinates` from `latitude`/`longitude` where they are still `NULL`. |

All four are guarded (`IF NOT EXISTS` / `DO` blocks / narrow `WHERE` clauses), so they
are idempotent and safe to re-run.

If `20260728020000` reports nothing, check for legacy negative amounts:

```sql
SELECT id, trip_id, description, amount FROM trip_expenses WHERE amount < 0;
```

Fix them, then finish the job with
`ALTER TABLE trip_expenses VALIDATE CONSTRAINT trip_expenses_amount_non_negative;`.

## CHECK constraints are invisible to `schema.prisma`

Prisma cannot represent `CHECK` constraints, so these four live only in migration SQL:

| Constraint | Table.column | Added by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `activity_cost_non_negative` | `activities.cost` | `20260220000000` |
| `lodging_cost_non_negative` | `lodging.cost` | `20260220000000` |
| `transportation_cost_non_negative` | `transportation.cost` | `20260220000000` |
| `trip_expenses_amount_non_negative` | `trip_expenses.amount` | `20260728020000` |

Each field carries a comment in `schema.prisma` pointing here. **`prisma db push` would
rebuild the schema without them** — never use `db push` against a real database; the
baseline re-creates them so a database built from it is complete.
