/**
 * OpeningHoursService — parse and evaluate OpenStreetMap `opening_hours` specifications.
 *
 * The full OSM opening_hours grammar is very large (holidays, month/week/year selectors,
 * variable times tied to sunrise/sunset, nth-weekday-of-month, fallback rules, comments…).
 * Implementing all of it correctly is a project in its own right, and a *wrong* answer here
 * is worse than no answer: telling a traveller a museum is open when it is closed defeats
 * the point, and crying wolf about a place that is actually open trains them to ignore the
 * warning. So this service implements a deliberately small, well-specified subset and
 * returns an explicit `UNKNOWN` for everything else instead of guessing.
 *
 * ── Supported ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - `24/7`
 * - Weekday selectors: `Mo`, `Tu`, `We`, `Th`, `Fr`, `Sa`, `Su` (case-insensitive)
 * - Weekday ranges, including wrapping ones: `Mo-Fr`, `Sa-Su`, `Fr-Mo`
 * - Weekday lists and combinations: `Mo,We,Fr`, `Mo-We,Fr`
 * - Time ranges `HH:MM-HH:MM`, several per rule: `Mo-Fr 09:00-12:00,13:00-18:00`
 * - Time ranges with no weekday selector, meaning every day: `09:00-17:00`
 * - Ranges crossing midnight: `Fr-Sa 20:00-02:00` (the rule belongs to the day it *starts*)
 * - `24:00` as an end time, and `00:00-24:00` / `00:00-00:00` meaning the whole day
 * - `off` / `closed`, with or without a weekday selector: `Su off`
 * - Multiple rules separated by `;`
 * - `PH` / `SH` (public/school holiday) selectors — recognised, see the note below
 *
 * ── Deliberately NOT supported (any of these makes the whole spec UNKNOWN) ────────────────
 * - Month and date selectors: `Jan-Mar`, `Dec 25`, `Apr 01-Oct 31`
 * - Year and week selectors: `2026 Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00`, `week 1-10`
 * - Nth-weekday-of-month: `Mo[1]`, `Su[-1]`, `Sa[1,3]`
 * - Variable times: `sunrise`, `sunset`, `dawn`, `dusk`, `(sunset-01:00)`
 * - Open-ended times: `08:00+`
 * - Fallback rules (`||`) and additional-rule separators (`,` between whole rules)
 * - Comments in quotes: `Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00 "by appointment"`
 * - The `unknown` keyword
 * - Hours past 24:00 (`Mo 22:00-26:00`)
 * - A bare weekday selector with no time part (`Mo-Fr`)
 *
 * ── Rule precedence ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Per the OSM specification, rules separated by `;` *override* earlier rules for the days
 * they select — they are not additive. So `Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00; We off` closes Wednesday, and
 * (correctly but perhaps surprisingly) `Mo-Fr 09:00-12:00; Mo-Fr 13:00-17:00` describes a
 * place open only in the afternoon. Multiple intervals in one day belong in one rule,
 * comma-separated.
 *
 * ── Public / school holidays ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * We have no holiday calendar, so for any given date we cannot know whether a `PH`/`SH`
 * rule applies. Rather than guess, a spec containing such a rule is evaluated twice: once
 * assuming the date is a holiday and once assuming it is not. If both readings agree the
 * answer is certain and is returned; if they disagree the result is `UNKNOWN`. This keeps
 * the common `Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00; PH off` useful on a Sunday (closed either way) while
 * refusing to commit on a Tuesday morning (open unless it happens to be a holiday).
 *
 * ── Timezone ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Opening hours are wall-clock times in the timezone of the *place*, which is neither UTC
 * nor the viewer's zone. Callers must pass the location's IANA timezone; the instant is
 * rendered into that zone with `date-fns-tz` before any weekday/minute arithmetic. An
 * unusable timezone yields `UNKNOWN`, never a fallback to UTC.
