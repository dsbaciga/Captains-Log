 * Emergency Card (feature #111).

 * the traveller-entered insurance and embassy details, the companions' medical
 * notes, and the raw location addresses the client uses to work out which
 * country's emergency numbers to print.
 *
 * Country *inference* is deliberately NOT done here. The stored override travels
 * with the payload as `countryCode` (from `Trip.countryCode`), but the lookup
 * table that turns a free-text address into an ISO code ships with the frontend
 * (`frontend/src/constants/countryFacts.ts`) precisely so the card still renders
 * when the device is offline and this endpoint is unreachable. Inferring on the
 * server would move that logic behind the network — the one place it must not be.
