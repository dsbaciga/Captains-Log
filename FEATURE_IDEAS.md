# Feature Ideas

This document tracks potential future enhancements for Captain's Log.

## Transportation

- **Add multi-day travel**: Support transportation that spans multiple days (e.g., long train journeys, cruises, multi-day road trips) with the ability to show them across the timeline.

## Photo Integration

- **Google Photos integration**: Connect to Google Photos to import photos directly into trips, similar to the existing Immich integration.
